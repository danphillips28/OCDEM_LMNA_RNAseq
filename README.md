# OCDEM_LMNA_RNAseq
This repository concerns RNA-sequencing data from an experiment lead by Professor Karpe and primarily carried out by DPhil student Keanu Paphiti. It will cover processing of the raw RNA-seq data on the HPC as well as downstream statistical analysis in RStudio. It serves both as a repository and teaching tool.
